Assembly for phylogenetic studies
=================================

For phylogenetic/phylogenomic studies, we need to assemble our trimmed reads
into contigs on a **per-bin basis**, referring back to the bins set setup during
trimming.  A bin is almost always one-individual's worth of data. 

When we talk about assembly, we generally mean that we want to take the whole
bunch of reads we generated during sequence capture and assemble those into
"contigs" or contiguous blocks of sequence.  So, we want to do something like
the following:

<insert assembly image>

It's important to note that we're assembline contigs while **blind** to the UCE
loci from which individual reads may have been derived.  The primer reason we're
doing this is because, if things worked as planned, we will have collected
reads from our taxa that do not directly overlap the UCE region we've targeted:

<insert overlap image>

As with everything in life, we have several assembly choices.  The two "best"
choices for *de-novo* assembly, in my opinion, are Velvet [] and ABySS []. I
tend to tell people to use Velvet, largely because of the excellent
VelvetOptimizer script, so I'll cover Velvet first.
